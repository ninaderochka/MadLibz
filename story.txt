Alice[n] is very bored and sleepy[a] while sitting[v] with her older
sister[n] outside, until she sees[v] a White  Rabbit[n] looking 
at his watch and talking[v] to himself. She follows[v] the  Rabbit[n] 
down a very deep rabbit[n]  hole and ends up far beneath the ground[n]
in a hall  with a tiny[a] locked door that leads to a beautiful[a]  garden . 
She eats[v] and  drinks[v]  things that make her  change[n]  in size ,
but she is still unable[a] to get through the door[n]  into the garden. 
When she becomes huge[a] , she cries in  frustration[n]  and when she  shrinks[v], 
she is small[a] enough to swim[v] around in a  pool[n]  made of her own  tears[n]  . In the  pool[n], 
she encounters many  creatures[n] , including a   Mouse[n] . 
The creatures and  Alice[n]   manage to get out of the  pool[n]  and dry off, but  Alice[n] 
is soon left alone. Alice[n]  finds the  Rabbit's[n]  houses and grows huge after  drinking[n]  a strange  liquid[a] . 
She terrifies the  rabbit[n]  and his  neighbors[n]  and grows very  small[a] again after fanning herself . Alice[n] 
then comes across a  Caterpillar[n]  smoking a  hookah[a] . He irritates Alice and  asks[v] her to recite  poetry[n] , 
which she cannot do properly. The  Caterpillar[n]
 informs  Alice[n]  that eating one  side[n]  of the mushroom 
he is sitting on will make her  larger[a]  but eating the other  side[n]  will make her  smaller[a] . Alice  
is still trying to become the right size to get into the   garden[n] .
